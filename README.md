# Natural-Selection-Modelling
 - Developed a model using various libraries in Python to understand Natural Selection in species.
 - Created a dynamic simulation to analyse a speciesâ€™ selection of specific traits in a closed environment, over time.

This is a project that me and my team made as part of the GE103 course.

The primary emphasis of this project revolved around these three key points:

## A. Growth of population
We made a simulation to see observe how a species grows or shrinks in a confined environment over time, as well as the influence of changing food resources on population growth.

## B. Selection of traits
A little percentage of mutation was permitted in some organisms' attributes in species chosen at random. We looked at how different traits are selected by nature and how different factors influence trait selection.

## C. Adaptation of species
We studied with shifting environmental conditions to see how a species adapts over generations to a changing habitat.
